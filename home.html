        <h2>Typhoon Ulysses (Vamco) - Overview</h2>
        <p>Typhoon Ulysses (international name: Vamco) was a Category 4-equivalent typhoon that struck the Philippines in November 2020. It caused severe flooding, displacement of families, and significant damage to infrastructure and livelihoods. The typhoon's strength led to wind speeds of 177 km/h, bringing heavy rainfall of 153mm.</p>
        <p>Key areas affected include Cagayan Valley, Metro Manila, and Bicol. Typhoon Ulysses resulted in devastating losses, including ₱1.11 billion in rice, ₱700 million in high-value crops, and ₱585 million in fisheries. Livestock, poultry, and farming equipment were also significantly impacted.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Secondary Disasters and Their Impact</h2>
        <p>The typhoon brought secondary disasters such as severe flooding and landslides, which caused injuries and destroyed homes, particularly in mountainous areas. Power outages were widespread due to strong winds and heavy rainfall. These secondary effects compounded the suffering of affected communities, delaying recovery efforts and heightening the urgency of aid and relief.</p>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Community Response and Recovery</h2>
        <p>The community prepared by creating evacuation plans, staying updated on weather warnings, and stocking necessary supplies. During the typhoon, local governments and rescue teams provided relief, distributing food, water, and clothing to affected families. After the storm, rebuilding efforts began, restoring damaged buildings, and improving shelter conditions. A focus on creating safer homes and disaster-resilient infrastructure was prioritized for future preparedness.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Health and Safety: Mitigating the Impact of Typhoons</h2>
        <p>Typhoon Ulysses caused an increase in disease outbreaks such as leptospirosis and dengue, especially due to floodwater contamination. The Department of Health (DOH) took proactive measures by distributing potable water and water filtration systems to affected areas. They also advised the public to take precautions and seek medical care in case of illness. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) coordinated relief efforts to prevent disease spread.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Mitigation Measures and Proposed Solutions</h2>
        <p>To mitigate the impacts of future typhoons, a key solution is the construction of strong, elevated evacuation centers built with typhoon-resistant materials. These centers should be located on higher ground to protect residents from strong winds and flooding. Additionally, improving infrastructure, such as flood-resistant drainage systems and reinforced roads, is critical to reducing long-term risks and enhancing recovery efforts.</p>
